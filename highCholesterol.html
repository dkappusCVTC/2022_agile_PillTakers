        <h2>List of medications for High Cholesterol</h2>
        <p>
            Cholesterol is found in your blood as a waxy-like substance. Your body 
            requires cholesterol for healthy cell function, but too much cholesterol 
            can pose serious risks for heart and blood vessel health. Those with high 
            cholesterol, can develop fatty cholesterol deposits which build up in 
            their blood vessels. Over time, these cholesterol deposits can continue 
            to grow, making it more and more difficult for blood to flow through your 
            arteries. This puts a strain on the heart as it has to work harder to pump 
            blood. On occasion, those cholesterol deposits can suddenly break off as a 
            mass and form a clot that travels through the blood vessels causing a 
            heart attack or stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
            A tendency toward high cholesterol can be inherited from family, but itâ€™s 
            more often the result of lifestyle choices including eating habits and 
            exercise frequency, which make it preventable and treatable. High 
            cholesterol is therefore treated with a healthy diet and regular exercise.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Statins</strong></p>
        <p>
            Statins are the most common medication for treating high cholesterol. 
            Since the human body naturally produces cholesterol for cell function, 
            statins work by reducing the function of your bodies natural cholesterol 
            production.

        <p><strong>PCSK9 Inhibitors</strong></p>
        <p>
            Recently approved by the FDA for treating high cholesterol, PCSK9 
            inhibitors are an injected medication which work with the liver to 
            filter LDL cholesterol (the bad form of cholesterol) out of the blood 
            stream. These medicines are often prescribed in addition to Statins so 
            they can work together in reducing overall cholesterol levels in the 
            bloodstream. PCSK9 inhibitors when taken together with Statins have 
            been shown to lower LDL cholesterol up to 75%.
