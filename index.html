        <h2>Do I need a medicine tracker like Pill Takers?</h2>
        <p><strong>Yes! Hereâ€™s why you should track your medication.</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you are taking multiple medications it gets hard to remember why you take certain medications. It also gets complicated
            when you might have multiple medications for multiple different reasons or illnesses. You should be aware of the medication you
            take and why exactly you take it. Your family members or friends should also be aware of the medication you are taking in case
            of emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is vital that you track your medication to ensure you see the progress of your treatments and maintain a personal record to see
            the improvement of your illness. This will also help you determine if you are experiencing any side effects as a result of the pills
            or medication you are taking. If you are starting new medications you should track it to see if any side effects appear and track
            information your doctor gave you about what to do in case of an emergency. This will especially help your caregivers in case of an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tracking your medication can be made easy using Pill Takers because it will allow you to input the medicine name, doses, and schedule it on
            our very easy to use calendar on our <a href="schedule.html">schedule page</a>.
